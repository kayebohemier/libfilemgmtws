										<h2>Where Did I Put That File?</h2>
										<p>Personal data management in professional contexts.</p>
										<p align="center";><img src="images/banner.png" alt="This is an XKCD Comics image of someone calling down a giant hole of deprecated file formats while a second person is deep in the middle of finding old high school poetry that was never deleted from ler hard drive."/></p>

									</header>
									<p>We teach research data management and see researchers benefit from thoughtful and mindful data management practices. Over the years, we've noticed ...</p>
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li>Researchers manage spreadsheets, reports, and statistical data</li>
											<li>Librarians manage spreadsheets, reports, and statistical data</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
									<p>... and <em>everyone</em> can benefit from these strategies. We’ve also all made the same kinds of mistakes &mdash; and we all have things on our hard drives from years ago that we haven't organized. These workshop notes are about the future and what <em>you</em> can do for Future You.</p>
										<h3>Are you a searcher or a structurer?</h3>
										<p><strong>Searchers</strong> re-find information using keywords and tags. <strong>Structurers</strong> re-find information by navigating hierarchical folder structures or representations of time. Most people are a bit of both! But most people <em>also</em> have a dominant one &mdash; Kate Nyhan is a searcher, and Kayleigh Bohémier is a structurer.</p>
										<p>The two strategies are complementary, such as when you search in a specific Box folder, and both require forethought &mdash; adding tags if the relevant and sufficiently specific keywords aren’t already present in the document might take less time up front that you’d invest in setting up and maintaining a folder structure, but <em>it still takes time</em>.</p>
										<p>In some cases, re-finding through searching can be faster than organizing, <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~swhittak/papers/chi2011_refinding_email_camera_ready.pdf">as detailed in this paper</a>. But searching also runs the risk of not being able to find it again, so don’t depend on it 100%. Structuring folders can make handovers easier in cases of staff departure and retirement.</p>

									<h3>Naming folders and files</h3>
									<p>
										
									<ul class="feature-icons">	
										<li class="fa-bolt">Avoid overlapping categories</li>
										<li class="fa-bolt">Use YYYYMMDDD_OtherConventions.ext for your filenames (starting with the year makes file sorting easy)</li>
										<li class="fa-bolt">Choose the most important aspects of your files and be consistent</li>
										<li class="fa-bolt">Have memorable and clear structures for your folders</li>
										<li class="fa-bolt">Put your naming conventions for files and folders in a README.txt file in the same directory as the files</li>
										<li class="fa-bolt">Print out your naming conventions for easy reference</li>
										<li class="fa-bolt">Avoid special characters (& # $ @ /  \  { } ? * ! : ‘ “)</li>
										<li class="fa-bolt">Use dashes or underscores instead of spaces</li>
									</ul>	
										
</p>
									<p>The final two tips above are important &mdash; especially if you want to program or make your files compatible with programming. Many file systems have trouble with special characters that <em>mean something</em> in terminal commands. Spaces in file names are also difficult when working in the command line.</p>

									<h4>Examples of naming conventions</h4>
									
									<p>When you use YYYYMMDDD_OtherConventions.ext for your filenames, it suddenly becomes much easier to manage your files. You don't have to worry about the date stamp disappearing, and you can remember chronologically when(ish) things happened — if you know you did a workshop in October 2016, you know that 201610 will begin the file name. This gives you powerful searching and sorting capabilities.</p>
									<p>Here are some examples of file names that are easy:
										<ul>
											<li>20170604_CSSSI-librarians-mtng-minutes.doc</li>
											<li>20170503_CSC-minutes.doc</li>
											<li>20160729_Fall-Astr-Geo-Phys-Courses.xls</li>
											<li>20161221_Physics-GOBI-analysis.xlsx</li>

											<li>20160504_Librarians-meeting_EmilyHorningPresentation.pptx</li>
											<li>20160504_Librarians-meeting_minutes.docx</li>
										</ul>
								</p>
									
									<h4>How does this work in practice?</h4>
										<p>On a Mac, you can customize the keyboard shortcut for Spotlight in the Mac settings, but it should be in your top menu bar as a magnifying glass icon. A good keyboard shortcut is <em>command-space</em> because one rarely needs to use that combination otherwise.</p>
										<p align="center";><img src="images/mac-searching-spotlight.png" width=80% alt="Mac Spotlight search image."></p>
										<p>In Windows, hit the windows icon key on your keyboard, then type in your search. With Cortana turned on, you can search across all files on OneDrive.</p>
										<p align="center";><img src="images/windows-searching-cortana.png" width=60% alt="Image of searching for files in Windows."></p>
									<h4>What about in email?</h4>
										<p>For <strong>Structurers</strong>, some of these tips may be helpful:</p>
										
										<ul class="feature-icons">
											<li class="fa-cubes">Organize by fiscal year (not relevant for all folders) &mdash; Good for mental mapping.</li>
											<li class="fa-cubes">Some tradeoffs between searchability and structure. When in a subfolder, you often can’t search the enclosing folders.</li>
										</ul>
										
										<p>In practice, that looks like this:</p>
										<p align="center";><img src="images/structurer-email-inbox.png" width=30% alt="Image of heavily organized folders in an email client."></p>
										
										<p>For <strong>Searchers</strong>, some of these tips may be helpful:</p>
										
										<ul class="feature-icons">
											<li class="fa-cubes">Know the terms you’re looking for &mdash; this works best for known items.</li>
											<li class="fa-cubes">Syntax and operators vary across mail clients.</li>
											<li class="fa-cubes">You can add informal tags to an email chain by forwarding it to yourself.</li>
										</ul>

									<h3>Version Control</h3>
									<p>Let’s start with a test: Can you tell which of these is the final version?</p>
									<p>
											<ul>
												<li>EBSCO JR1 2014.xlsx</li>
												<li>EBSCO JR1 2014 cost per use added.xlsx</li>
												<li>EBSCO JR1 2014 for johndoe.xlsx</li>
												<li>EBSCO JR1 2014 FINAL FOR SENDING.xlsx</li>
												<li>EBSCO JR1 2014 corrected.xlsx</li>
												<li>EBSCO JR1 2014 corrected FINAL.xlsx</li>
												<li>EBSCO JR1 2014 for johndoe SEND THIS ONE.xlsx</li>
												<li>EBSCO JR1 2014 for johndoe FINAL CORRECTED.xlsx</li>
											</ul>
										</p>
											<p>How about these?
											
											<ul>
												<li>outreach handout 2014-2015.pdf</li>
												<li>outreach handout FINAL 2014-15.pdf</li>
												<li>outreach handout yale fonts 2014.pdf</li>
												<li>outreach handout 2014 USE THIS ONE.pdf</li>
												<li>outreach handout GIVE TO EVERYONE.pdf</li>
												<li>outreach handout workshop list 2014 USE THIS ONE.pdf</li>
												<li>outreach handout workshop list 2014-2015 FINAL VERSION.pdf</li>
											</ul>
										</p>
									
										<p><strong>Probably not.</strong> <font color="red">You can’t tell which of these is actually the final version without wasting time. From the file names, you also have no idea whether all of these xlsx files (or handouts) are actually the same file or different ones.</font>
										</p>
										
										<p>When doing version control, the following tips are a great starting place:
											
											<ul class="feature-icons">
												<li class="fa-coffee">Keep a pristine, original, identifiable copy.</li>
												<li class="fa-coffee">Use version control to always find the most recent version of a file.</li>
												<li class="fa-coffee">Include version in file naming convention.</li>
												<li class="fa-coffee">Use tools like Git, Box, or Drive with automatic versioning.</li>
											</ul>
											
											One great tip is to put the original information and data in a zip file, as shown in the image below. When something is kept in a zip file, it’s difficult to accidentally modify the files &mdash; you’d have to unzip first. 
										</p>
										
										<p align="center";><img src="images/version-control-example.png" width=60% alt="Version control screenshot."></p>
									
										<h4>In the Cloud?</h4>
										
										<p>Most people use cloud services for some (or all) of their work &mdash; and it’s important to be aware of your versioning and document management context there. Whenever you use cloud services for versioning and document management, ask yourself a few questions:	
											<ul>
												<li>Is this personal or enterprise account?</li>
												<li>How long do they keep versions?</li>
												<ul>
													<li>Dropbox: 30 Days</li>
													<li>Box: 100 Versions (Enterprise)</li>
													<li>Google Drive: ??? (was 30 days)</li>
												</ul>
												<li>Is there is a data retention policy?</li>
												<li>How secure is the storage? How secure do you need it to be?</li>
												<li>Can you sync your files locally and is that important?</li>
											</ul>
										<strong>The best back up strategy is backing up in multiple locations on <em>and</em> off the web.</strong>

										</p>
																				
											<h4>Diff Checking</h4>
									
											<p>If you run into a situation where you <em>do</em> need to tell quickly if two files are drastically different, <a href="https://www.diffchecker.com">DiffChecker</a> is a great place to do that.</p>
										
											<p align="center";><img src="images/diff-checker-example.png" width=100% alt="This image is a screenshot of what DiffChecker looks like when one submits two files to the software for comparison."></p>
											
											<h4>Some words of caution about versioning and the Cloud in your professional lives ...</h4>
									
											<p>We are all managing multiple aspects of our identities online. Keep in mind that when doing versioning and file management on your work computers, <a href="http://web.library.yale.edu/lit/workstation-policy">Yale policies on workstation use apply</a>. Especially if you have a personal Google account that you have attached to your web browser, be aware that Google <em>by default</em> will sync all of your data across every device &mdash; you have to disable this manually in the browser settings. This includes bookmarks, web histories, cookies, and more &mdash; point being that this isn’t always data that you want on your work computer.</p>

									<h3>Documentation</h3>
									
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/model-research-memory.png" alt="This is a graph showing that, following the time when someone uses information, documents, or data, it immediately starts to be forgotten - so back things up and keep good documentation!"  /></span>Human memory is fallible.

									<h3>Managing Collaboration</h3>
									<p>You can (and should) use these same strategies for collaborative work &mdash; and this can come up briefly in meetings. Not everyone is a Searcher or a Structurer, so this will be a dialogue process. Here are some starting places:
									<ul>
										<li>Decide on a common storage location that everyone can access.</li>
									<li>Google Drive allows for live collaborative editing.</li>
									<li>Git/Github for collaborating on code (or any files).</li>
									<li>Decide on a common folder structure and naming convention ... <strong>and document it!</strong></li>
									<li>Keep your local file up-to-date with the group files.</li>
									<li>If using a cloud service, sync your files.</li>
